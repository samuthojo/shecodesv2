                <p>
                    With the increased smartphones it only makes sense to arm our girls with skills needed to put
                    amazing apps into those phones from smart utility apps
                    like schedulers to fun and engaging games for kids.

                    Research shows that girls are maybe the best designers and builders.
                    We therefore want to make sure we bring out the builder and creators
                    in our girls and remind them that it's not 'for boys'.

                <h3>Arts & Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Hand out drawing boards to nursery
                    kids and you'll see that the girls will come up with some pretty nice
                    works of art. So what we do in is empower our girls with tools to take their skills to a pro level.
